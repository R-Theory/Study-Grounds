# Study Grounds

A living repository documenting my path as a CS student and aspiring Deep Learning Engineer.

## What This Is

I'm a Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill who does a lot of learning outside the classroom—especially in machine learning and deep learning. This repo exists to organize that work and show what I actually understand, not just what my transcript says.

You'll find:
- **Coursework** from UNC and other sources
- **Self-study** from Stanford lectures, research papers, online courses
- **Projects** where I build things to test my understanding
- **Implementations** of papers and algorithms from scratch
- **Notes** that connect theory to practice. 

> I believe in learning by doing. I implement concepts from first principles, experiment with architectures, and work through math by coding it. This repo is proof of that process.  

## What's Coming

This is a work in progress. As I learn, this grows. Expect:
- Deep learning projects (my main focus)
- Paper implementations and reading notes
- Mathematical foundations applied to ML
- Tools and infrastructure I build for learning
- Academic coursework organized and explained

## About Me

CS student with a focus on deep learning engineering. I spend more time reading papers and building models than I probably should, but that's where I learn best.
