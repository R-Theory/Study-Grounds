# Study Grounds

A living repository documenting my path as a CS student and aspiring Deep Learning Engineer.

## What This Is

I'm a Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill who does a lot of learning outside the classroom—especially in machine learning and deep learning. This repo exists to organize that work and show what I actually understand, not just what my transcript says.

You'll find:
- **Coursework** from UNC and other sources
- **Self-study** from Stanford lectures, research papers, online courses
- **Projects** where I build things to test my understanding
- **Implementations** of papers and algorithms from scratch
- **Notes** that connect theory to practice. 

> I believe in learning by doing. I implement concepts from first principles, experiment with architectures, and work through math by coding it. This repo is proof of that process.  

## What's Coming

This is a work in progress. As I learn, this grows. Expect:
- Deep learning projects (my main focus)
- Paper implementations and reading notes
- Mathematical foundations applied to ML
- Tools and infrastructure I build for learning
- Academic coursework organized and explained

## About Me

CS student with a focus on deep learning engineering. I spend more time reading papers and building models than I probably should, but that's where I learn best.

## Agogy
> *Agogy* indicating a method or practice of leading, guiding, or teaching

**Pedagogy:** Teacher-controlled learning where the instructor determines what, when, and how you learn. This is typical in universities with structured syllabi, required readings, scheduled lectures, and predetermined assessments. The teacher is the central authority guiding your learning path.

**Andragogy:** Self-directed learning where you have significant autonomy but still receive guidance and structure from an instructor. An online course fits here if it has an instructor providing guidance, but you choose to take it and have some control over your pace and approach. The key is that you're motivated to learn and take responsibility, but there's still an expert providing direction.

**Heutagogy:** Completely self-determined learning where you decide everything: what to learn, how to learn it, what resources to use, and how to assess your progress. Reading research articles and resources you found yourself can be heutagogy, but only if you're truly determining your own learning path without external curriculum or guidance.
