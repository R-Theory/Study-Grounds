> Guided self-directed learning — you choose what to learn, but an expert designs the curriculum and provides instruction.

---

## Purpose

This directory holds materials for **structured learning experiences you voluntarily enroll in** outside of formal university coursework. The key distinction from Pedagogy is that *you* decide to take the course, but an instructor or organization still designs the content and guides your learning path.

Examples include online certifications, bootcamps, MOOCs, and professional development courses.

## What Belongs Here

- Certification study materials and coursework
- Online course content from platforms (Coursera, edX, Udemy, etc.) where an instructor leads the curriculum
- Bootcamp projects and exercises
- Professional development training materials

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- University coursework (that goes in [Pedagogy](../Pedagogy/README.md))
- Courses you follow at your own pace with no instructor structure — if you're choosing your own path through the material, it's [Heutagogy](../Heutagogy/README.md)
- Pure self-study from books or papers (that's [Heutagogy](../Heutagogy/README.md))

## Naming Conventions

- Subdirectories named by certification or program (e.g., `AWS-Cloud-Practitioner/`, `Google-Data-Analytics/`)
