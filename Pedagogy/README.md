# Pedagogy

> Formal, instructor-led education — coursework where the curriculum, pacing, and assessment are determined by the institution and its instructors.

---

## Purpose

This directory holds all materials related to **formal academic coursework** at a university or college. The instructor decides what is taught, when, and how it is assessed. Your role is to learn, practice, and demonstrate mastery within that structure.

## What Belongs Here

- Course repositories (assignments, labs, projects given by instructors)
- Syllabi and course schedules
- Textbooks and assigned reading materials
- Course-specific sandbox/experimental projects that extend assigned work
- Any materials directly tied to a formally enrolled course

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Self-selected online courses (those go in [Heutagogy](../Heutagogy/README.md) or [Andragogy](../Andragogy/README.md))
- Personal projects unrelated to a course
- General-purpose tools or scripts (those go in [tools-and-infrastructure](../tools-and-infrastructure/README.md))

## Naming Conventions

- Semester directories: `Semester #/` (e.g., `Semester 4/`)
- Course directories: Use the official course code (e.g., `COMP110/`, `STOR155/`)
