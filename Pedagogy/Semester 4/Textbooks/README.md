## Purpose

Stores **textbook PDFs and supplementary reading** for each course this semester. Each course gets its own subdirectory to keep materials organized.

## What Belongs Here

- Textbook PDFs
- Supplementary reading materials assigned by instructors
- Reference books relevant to a specific course

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Syllabi (those go in [Syllabi](../Syllabi/README.md))
- Your own notes on the textbooks (those go in the O-Vault)
- Research papers you found yourself (those go in `Heutagogy/research-notes/`)

## Naming Conventions

- One subdirectory per course code
- Textbook files named by title (e.g., `OpenIntro Statistics.pdf`)
