# COMP110 Workspace

> Container for the COMP110 assignment workspace repository.

## Purpose

Holds the `comp110-26s-workspace/` directory, which is the course-provided assignment repository. That workspace is **gitignored** because it is managed as its own git repository by the course.

## What Belongs Here

- The `comp110-26s-workspace/` directory (gitignored, managed independently)
- Any workspace-level configuration

## Note

The contents of `comp110-26s-workspace/` are excluded from this project's git tracking. It has its own git history managed by the COMP110 course infrastructure.
