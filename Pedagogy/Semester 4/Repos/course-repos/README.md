# course-repos

> Active course repositories — the code, assignments, and lab work directly assigned by instructors.

---

## Purpose

This directory contains **one subdirectory per enrolled course**, each holding the actual working repository for that course's assignments, exercises, and projects. These are the repos you submit work from.

## What Belongs Here

- Assignment code and submissions
- Lab exercises and starter code provided by instructors
- Course-specific configuration files
- Completed exercises and project files
- Instructor-provided course resources (slides, notes, etc.)

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Personal experimental projects extending course material (those go in [sandbox-repos](../sandbox-repos/README.md))
- Textbooks or syllabi (those go in `Textbooks/` or `Syllabi/`)
- Study notes (those go in the O-Vault)

## Naming Conventions

- One directory per course, named by **official course code**: `COMP110/`, `DATA120/`, `PSYC101/`, `STOR155/`
- Internal structure follows whatever the course/instructor provides
