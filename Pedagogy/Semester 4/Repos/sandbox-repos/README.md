# sandbox-repos

> Experimental projects tied to coursework — personal explorations that go beyond what was assigned but are inspired by course material.

---

## Purpose

This directory holds **personal projects that extend or experiment with concepts from formal courses** but are not directly assigned work. The key distinction from [course-repos](../course-repos/README.md) is that these are self-initiated. The distinction from [Heutagogy](../../../../Heutagogy/README.md) projects is that sandbox repos are **directly inspired by and related to** a current course.

## What Belongs Here

- Projects that apply course concepts in new ways
- Experimental implementations of ideas covered in class
- Extended versions of assignments that go beyond requirements
- Prototypes and proof-of-concepts related to course topics

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Assigned coursework (that goes in [course-repos](../course-repos/README.md))
- Projects unrelated to any current course (those go in `Heutagogy/projects/`)

## Naming Conventions

- Descriptive project names, hyphenated (e.g., `Data-Models-Inference/`)

## Structure

```
sandbox-repos/
└── Data-Models-Inference/    ← Custom data modeling project
