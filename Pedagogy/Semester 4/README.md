# Semester 4

> Spring 2026 at UNC Chapel Hill — all materials for the current academic semester.

---

## Purpose

This directory is a **self-contained unit** grouping everything related to Semester 4 (Spring 2026). All coursework, syllabi, textbooks, and schedules for this term live here. This keeps coursework cleanly separated between semesters.

## What Belongs Here

- Course repositories (assignments, labs, code)
- Syllabi for each enrolled course
- Textbooks and reading materials
- Course schedules and calendars
- Sandbox/experimental projects related to this semester's coursework

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Materials that span multiple semesters (put those at the `Pedagogy/` level)
- Notes and study guides (those go in the O-Vault)

## Naming Conventions

- Course repos: Named by official course code (`COMP110/`, `STOR155/`)
- Syllabi: `<COURSE>_syllabus.pdf` or the original filename from the institution
