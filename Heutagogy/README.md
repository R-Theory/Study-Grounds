# Heutagogy

> Completely self-determined learning — you decide what to learn, how to learn it, and when. No instructor, no syllabus unless you make one yourself.

---

## Purpose

This directory holds materials from **entirely self-driven learning**. You are both the student and the curriculum designer. This is where curiosity-driven exploration lives — reading research papers, building personal projects, working through courses you discovered on your own.

The core philosophy: learning by doing, implementing from first principles, and following your own intellectual interests.

## What Belongs Here

- Self-selected courses and tutorials (e.g., *Zero to Mastery: Learn PyTorch*)
- Personal projects built to explore a concept
- Research paper notes and analysis
- Notebooks, experiments, and prototypes driven by personal curiosity
- Any learning material where you control the entire process

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- University coursework (that goes in [Pedagogy](../Pedagogy/README.md))
- Courses with a formal instructor guiding you through a set curriculum (that's [Andragogy](../Andragogy/README.md))
- Infrastructure/tooling (that goes in [tools-and-infrastructure](../tools-and-infrastructure/README.md))

## Naming Conventions

- Course directories: Full course name, hyphenated (e.g., `Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning/`)
- Project directories: Descriptive project name, hyphenated (e.g., `Transformer-From-Scratch/`)
- Research notes: Named after the paper or topic
