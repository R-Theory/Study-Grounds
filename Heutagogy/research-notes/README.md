# research-notes

> Deep dives into research papers, technical writing, and scholarly material — reading and analyzing the source material of your field.

---

## Purpose

This directory holds **notes from reading and analyzing research papers, technical blog posts, and other scholarly material**. The goal is to break down complex work into your own understanding — not just summarize, but engage critically with the ideas.

## What Belongs Here

- Paper annotations and breakdowns (section-by-section analysis)
- Key takeaways and insights from technical reading
- Connections between papers (how ideas build on each other)
- Questions and open threads raised by the reading

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Code implementations inspired by papers (those go in [projects](../projects/README.md))
- Course reading notes assigned by an instructor (those go in the course's vault directory)

## Naming Conventions

- One directory per paper or topic, named after the **paper title** or **topic**
- Individual sections as separate notes within that directory (e.g., `Abstract.md`, `Introduction.md`)
