# courses

> Courses you chose to take on your own — no instructor requirement, no enrollment, just self-determined structured learning.

---

## Purpose

This directory holds **structured courses you've chosen to work through independently**. Unlike Andragogy courses (where you enroll and follow an instructor), these are fully self-paced — you found the material and decided to work through it on your own terms.

## What Belongs Here

- Course notebooks (Jupyter, Markdown)
- Exercise solutions and implementations
- Code written while following along with course material
- Your own notes and annotations on the course content

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- University coursework (that goes in [Pedagogy](../../Pedagogy/README.md))
- Instructor-led online courses you enrolled in (those go in [Andragogy](../../Andragogy/README.md))
- Standalone personal projects not following a course structure (those go in [projects](../projects/README.md))

## Naming Conventions

- One directory per course, using the **full course title**
- Include a `README.md` in each course directory describing the course and your progress
