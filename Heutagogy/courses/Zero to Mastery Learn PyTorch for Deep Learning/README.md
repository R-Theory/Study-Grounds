# Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning

**Source**: [learnpytorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)  
**Status**: In Progress | Completed  
**Duration**: [Month Year - Month Year]

## Why This Course

Building foundational PyTorch skills for deep learning implementation. This course bridges theory to practice—focusing on how to actually build and train neural networks rather than just understanding the math.

## Learning Goals

- Master PyTorch fundamentals (tensors, autograd, nn.Module)
- Implement neural networks from scratch and with PyTorch
- Understand training loops, loss functions, and optimization
- Work with real datasets and model architectures
- Build practical DL skills for research and projects

## Key Topics Covered

- PyTorch basics and tensor operations
- Building neural networks with nn.Module
- Computer vision with CNNs
- Transfer learning
- [Add more as you progress]

## My Implementations

- [Link to specific projects/notebooks you built]
- [Another implementation]

## Notes

[Optional: Add specific insights, challenges you faced, or connections to other learning]
