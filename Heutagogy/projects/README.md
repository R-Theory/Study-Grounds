# projects

> Hands-on projects driven by curiosity — building things to learn, not following a course or assignment.

---

## Purpose

This directory holds **personal projects that exist purely for learning through building**. No course, no instructor, no curriculum — just an idea you want to implement to understand a concept more deeply.

## What Belongs Here

- Projects built to explore a concept (e.g., building a transformer from scratch)
- Implementations of algorithms or architectures from papers
- Prototypes and experiments driven by personal curiosity
- Any self-initiated coding project whose primary goal is learning

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Projects that follow a structured course (those go in [courses](../courses/README.md))
- Course-related experimental projects (those go in `Pedagogy/.../sandbox-repos/`)
- Research paper notes without code (those go in [research-notes](../research-notes/README.md))

## Naming Conventions

- Descriptive project name, hyphenated (e.g., `Transformer-From-Scratch/`, `GAN-Experiments/`)
- Include a `README.md` in each project describing the goal and what you're learning
