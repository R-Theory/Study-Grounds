# Heutagogy

> Vault notes for self-determined learning — your notes from independent research, self-selected courses, and personal exploration.

## Purpose

Contains your personal notes from entirely self-driven learning. Mirrors the repo root's `Heutagogy/` directory but holds notes and analysis rather than code and notebooks.

## What Belongs Here

- Notes from self-selected courses
- Research paper annotations and breakdowns
- Concept notes from independent study
