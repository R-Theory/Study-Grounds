# Pedagogy

> Vault notes for formal university coursework — your personal understanding of instructor-led material.

## Purpose

Contains all your **study notes, guides, and flashcards** for formal academic courses. Organized by institution and semester. This mirrors the repo root's `Pedagogy/` directory but holds knowledge artifacts rather than source materials.

## What Belongs Here

- Study notes and summaries you've written
- Exam preparation materials (study guides, cheat sheets, flashcards)
- Chapter notes and concept breakdowns

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Textbooks, syllabi, or instructor-provided files (those stay in the repo root)
- Assignment code or submissions
