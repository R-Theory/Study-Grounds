# Research Methods (~12 questions)

## I. What is Research?

**Definition:** Process of gaining information to come to a conclusion

### Goals of Research:
1. **Measurement and description** - accurately describe behavior
2. **Understanding and prediction** - explain and predict behavior
3. **Application and control** - use knowledge to solve real-world problems

### Guiding Principles:
| Principle | Definition | Method |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Rationalism** | Gaining knowledge through REASON and LOGIC | Thinking, deducing, forming hypotheses |
| **Empiricism** | Gaining knowledge through OBSERVATION and EXPERIENCE | Testing, experimenting, collecting data |

**Why need BOTH?** Rationalism helps form hypotheses; Empiricism tests if the reasoning is correct. "Think smart, then test it."

## II. The Scientific Method

**Definition:** Steps scientists use to arrive at the most likely valid conclusion

### Steps of Research:

**Pre-Step 1: Get to know the topic**
- Direct observation
- Indirect observation (library research, popular theories, **peer-reviewed journal articles**)

**Step 1: Formulate a Hypothesis**
- **Theory** = broad explanation of many observations; generates many hypotheses
- **Hypothesis** = specific, testable prediction derived from a theory
- **Operational definition** = definition in terms of OPERATIONS (actions) used to measure something
  - Example: "Aggression" operationally defined as "number of times child hits another child in 30 minutes"

**Step 2: Design the Study**
- Choose research method (experiment, quasi-experiment, non-experiment)

**Step 3: Collect the Data**
- Methods: direct observation, questionnaires, interviews, archival data, physiological readings

**Step 4: Analyze Data; Draw Conclusions**
- Use descriptive and inferential statistics

**Step 5: Report the Findings**
- Write report in APA format
- Submit to peer-reviewed journal
- "Publish or Perish"

## III. Research Methods

### A. Experiments
**Purpose:** Determine CAUSALITY (cause-and-effect relationships)

**Key Features:**
- Manipulation of a variable
- Random assignment to groups
- Control over extraneous variables

**Can make CAUSAL CONCLUSIONS** (unlike non-experiments!)

### B. Quasi-Experiments
- Looks like an experiment BUT the IV has NOT been manipulated by experimenter
- Cannot make causal conclusions

### C. Non-Experiments (Descriptive/Correlational Studies)

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Naturalistic Observation** | 1. Observe phenomenon naturally<br>2. Good starting point for unknown topics<br>3. Can use with animals | *Reactivity (hard to be unobtrusive)<br>*Qualitative data hard to analyze<br>*Environment can be chaotic |
| **Case Study** | 1. In-depth view of phenomenon<br>2. Compelling real-life evidence | *Lack of objectivity<br>*May be unusual case |
| **Survey** | 1. Get data on hard-to-observe behavior<br>2. Large sample sizes possible | *Sampling bias from declining response rates<br>*Self-report issues (see below) |
| **Experiment** | 1. Precise control<br>2. CAN make causal conclusions | *Artificial situations (lack ecological validity)<br>*Ethical/practical concerns |

## IV. Experimental Design - CRITICAL FOR EXAM

### Key Terms:

**Variable** = anything that can vary/change (e.g., intelligence level, hair color)

**Independent Variable (IV)** = the variable that is MANIPULATED by the experimenter
- The presumed CAUSE

**Dependent Variable (DV)** = the variable that is MEASURED; may be affected by the IV
- The presumed EFFECT

**Example:** "Do blondes have more fun?"
- IV = hair color (manipulated)
- DV = amount of fun (measured)

**Levels** = number of ways the IV is manipulated
- Example: Hair color with 3 levels (blonde, brunette, red)

**Experimental Group** = the group "of interest" (receives treatment)

**Control Group** = comparison group (no treatment or different treatment)

### Random Assignment
**Definition:** Each participant has an EQUAL chance of being assigned to ANY group

**Why important?**
- Decreases chances that groups differ BEFORE the manipulation
- Spreads extraneous variables equally across groups
- Without it, results are CONFOUNDED

### Extraneous vs. Confounding Variables

| Type | Definition | Effect on Study |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Extraneous Variable** | Variable that COULD influence results BUT is spread EQUALLY across groups | Study still valid (controlled for) |
| **Confounding Variable** | Variable that influences results AND is NOT equal across groups | Study is INVALID/inconclusive |

**Example - SAT Prep Study:**
- Want to know if new SAT prep course is effective
- IQ could affect SAT scores
- IQ is **extraneous** if average IQ is SIMILAR between groups
- IQ is **confounding** if experimental group has 20-point higher average IQ

**Key insight:** Random assignment converts potential confounding variables into extraneous variables!

### Within-Subject/Repeated Measures Design
- Same participants tested under ALL conditions
- Need to **counterbalance** to control for order effects

---

## V. Statistics

### Descriptive Statistics
**Purpose:** Summarize and describe data

- **Central tendency:** Mean, median, mode
- **Dispersion:** Standard deviation, variance
- **Correlation** (see below)

### Correlation

**Correlation coefficient (r):**
- Ranges from -1 to +1
- **Strength:** Distance from 0
  - r = .2 = negligible
  - r = .5 = moderate
  - r = .8 = very strong
  - r = 1 = perfect relationship
- **Direction:** + (positive) or - (negative)
  - Positive: variables move in SAME direction
  - Negative: variables move in OPPOSITE directions

**CRITICAL:** Correlation does NOT mean causation!
- **3rd variable problem:** A third variable could cause both
- Example: Ice cream sales correlate with drowning deaths (3rd variable = summer heat)

### Inferential Statistics
**Purpose:** Determine if sample results can be generalized to the population

**Logic:**
1. Researchers want "universal" truths
2. Impossible to measure everyone
3. Use samples of the population
4. Inferential statistics tells probability results were due to CHANCE

**Significance:**
- If p > .05 (>5% chance it's a fluke) → CANNOT generalize
- If p < .05 (<5% chance it's a fluke) → CAN generalize to population

**Examples:** T-tests, Chi-test, F-test, Multiple regression

## VI. Research Challenges/Potential Problems

### Sampling Bias
- Sample not representative of population
- Sample size too small
- Don't rely on anecdotal cases!

### Experimenter Expectation/Bias
- Experimenter unconsciously influences results

### Participant Expectation/Bias
- **Placebo effect:** Improvement due to BELIEF in treatment, not treatment itself

### Blind Studies
| Type | Who is "blind" | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Single-blind** | Participants don't know their condition | Controls for participant bias |
| **Double-blind** | NEITHER participants NOR experimenters know conditions | Controls for BOTH biases |

### Self-Report Distortions
- Intentional deception
- Social desirability bias (want to look good)
- Yay-sayers and nay-sayers
- Order effects
- Memory lapses
- Poorly worded questions

### Replication
- Studies should be repeatable
- **Meta-analysis:** Statistical analysis combining results from many studies

---

## VII. Ethics in Research

### Why Ethics Committees?
- **Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment** showed need for ethics oversight
- All studies must be approved by ethics committee (IRB)

### Key Ethical Principles:
1. Participants can **quit at any time** (even after signing consent)
2. Participants should NOT be exposed to **harmful conditions**
3. Participants have right to **privacy**
4. **Deception** only when justified; must **debrief** ASAP
5. **Animals:** Consider suffering, importance of research, likelihood of benefits; must have decent living conditions

## Practice Questions:

1. A researcher wants to know if caffeine improves memory. She gives one group coffee and another group decaf, then tests their memory. What is the IV? DV? Is this an experiment?

2. A study finds r = -.75 between stress and immune function. What does this mean? Can we conclude stress CAUSES weakened immunity?

3. Why is random assignment so important in experiments?

4. What's the difference between an extraneous and confounding variable?

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

1. IV = caffeine (manipulated); DV = memory score (measured); YES it's an experiment (IV manipulated, can make causal conclusions)

2. Strong negative correlation - as stress increases, immune function decreases. NO - correlation ≠ causation (could be 3rd variable like poor sleep)

3. Random assignment ensures groups are equivalent BEFORE manipulation, so any differences after must be due to the IV, not pre-existing differences

4. Both could influence results, but extraneous is spread equally across groups (controlled for), while confounding is NOT equal across groups (makes study inconclusive)
