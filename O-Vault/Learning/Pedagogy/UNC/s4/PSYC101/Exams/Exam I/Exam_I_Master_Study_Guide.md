### Chapter 2: Research Methods (~12 Qs) - MOST QUESTIONS!

**Critical Distinctions:**
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Theory** | Broad explanation, generates hypotheses |
| **Hypothesis** | Specific, testable prediction |
| **IV** | Manipulated (cause) |
| **DV** | Measured (effect) |
| **Extraneous** | Could affect results, spread EQUALLY |
| **Confounding** | Affects results, NOT equal (invalidates!) |

**Types of Studies:**
| Type | Can Determine Causality? |
|------|--------------------------|
| Experiment | YES - manipulation + random assignment |
| Quasi-experiment | NO - no manipulation |
| Correlation | NO - just shows relationship |

**Statistics Quick Reference:**
- **r = .2** → negligible
- **r = .5** → moderate
- **r = .8** → very strong
- **p < .05** → significant (can generalize)
- **Correlation ≠ Causation!**

**Bias Controls:**
- Single-blind: Participants don't know condition
- Double-blind: Neither participants nor experimenters know

### Chapter 3: Biological Bases (~10 Qs)

**Neuron Parts:**
| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| Dendrites | RECEIVE |
| Soma | PROCESS |
| Axon | TRANSMIT |
| Myelin | SPEED UP |

**Key Neurotransmitters:**
| NT | Function |
|----|----------|
| GABA | Main INHIBITORY |
| Glutamate | Main EXCITATORY |
| ACh | Muscle (PNS), Memory (CNS) |
| Dopamine | Movement, addiction, mood |
| Serotonin (5-HT) | Sleep, mood, eating |
| Endorphins | Decrease PAIN |

**Brain Imaging:**
| Tool | Type |
|------|------|
| CT | Structural (X-rays) |
| MRI | Structural (best resolution) |
| PET | Functional (radioactive glucose) |
| fMRI | Both |

**Brain Regions:**
| Region | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Medulla | Vital functions (breathing, heart) |
| Cerebellum | Motor coordination |
| Thalamus | Sensory relay (except smell!) |
| Hypothalamus | 4 Fs |
| Hippocampus | Memory |
| Amygdala | Fear |

**Lobes & Primary Cortex:**
| Lobe | Primary Cortex |
|------|----------------|
| Occipital | Visual |
| Temporal | Auditory |
| Parietal | Somatosensory |
| Frontal | Motor + Prefrontal |

**Lateralization:**
- **Left:** Language (Broca's = production, Wernicke's = comprehension)
- **Right:** Spatial, Emotional

---

### Chapter 4: Sensation & Perception (~10 Qs)

**Sensation vs. Perception:**
- **Sensation** = DETECTING stimuli
- **Perception** = INTERPRETING stimuli

**Light Properties:**
| Property | Determines |
|----------|------------|
| Wavelength | Color (Red=long, Violet=short) |
| Amplitude | Brightness |
| Purity | Saturation |

**Rods vs. Cones:**
| Feature | Rods | Cones |
|---------|------|-------|
| Light | Dim (scotopic) | Bright (photopic) |
| Location | Periphery | Center/Fovea |
| Detail | Low | High (acuity) |
| Color | No | Yes |

**Visual Pathway:**
Light → Cornea → Pupil → Lens → Vitreous humor → Retina (ganglion → bipolar → **rods/cones**) → Optic nerve → Thalamus (LGN) → Occipital cortex

**Color Theories:**
| Theory | Level | Explains |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Trichromatic | Photoreceptors | 3 cone types |
| Opponent Process | Bipolar+ | Afterimages, no "reddish-green" |
| **BOTH are correct at different levels!** |

**Sound Properties:**
| Property | Determines |
|----------|------------|
| Frequency | Pitch |
| Amplitude | Loudness |
| Purity | Timbre |

**Ear Pathway:**
Pinna → Tympanic membrane → Ossicles (hammer, anvil, stirrup) → Oval window → Cochlea (basilar membrane, **hair cells**)

**Pitch Theories:**
| Theory | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Place | HIGH pitches |
| Frequency | LOW pitches |

**The ONE Sense That Doesn't Go Through Thalamus:**
**OLFACTION (SMELL)**

**Pain:**
- C fibers = SLOW (dull, aching)
- A-delta = FAST (sharp)
- Gate Control Theory (Melzack & Wall)
  - Peripheral triggers: rubbing, acupuncture (closes gate)
  - Central triggers: distraction, emotions

## High-Yield Topics (Most Likely to Be Tested)

1. **IV vs. DV identification** - Practice scenarios!
2. **Extraneous vs. Confounding variables** - Know the difference!
3. **Correlation ≠ Causation** - Classic exam question
4. **Schools of thought differences** - Especially Structuralism vs. Functionalism
5. **Neurotransmitter functions** - Especially GABA, Glutamate, Dopamine, Serotonin
6. **Brain region functions** - Especially Thalamus, Hippocampus, Amygdala
7. **Rods vs. Cones** - Know all differences
8. **Color vision theories** - Both correct at different levels
9. **Which sense bypasses thalamus?** - SMELL!
10. **Psychology divisions** - Be able to identify from scenarios

---

## Common Exam Traps

1. **Hall vs. James** - Hall = first FORMAL US lab
2. **Quasi-experiment vs. Experiment** - No manipulation = quasi
3. **Clinical Psychology** - Both research AND applied
4. **MRI vs. fMRI** - MRI = structural only; fMRI = both
5. **Prefrontal cortex maturity** - ~25 years old
6. **Olfaction** - Only sense not going through thalamus
