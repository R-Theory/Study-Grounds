# Sensation & Perception (~10 questions)

## I. Sensation vs. Perception

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Sensation** | The process of DETECTING physical stimuli (light, sound, etc.) through sensory organs |
| **Perception** | The process of INTERPRETING and organizing sensory information into meaningful experiences |

**Key insight:** Sensation is about detection; Perception is about interpretation

## II. Visual System

### A. The Stimulus: Light
- **Electromagnetic radiation** between 480-760 nanometers

| Property of Light | What It Determines | Details |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Wavelength** (distance between peaks) | **Color** | ROYGBIV: Red = LONGEST wavelength, Violet = SHORTEST |
| **Amplitude** (height of wave) | **Brightness** | Higher amplitude = brighter; same wavelength can look different based on brightness |
| **Purity** (complexity of waveform) | **Saturation** | How vivid/pure the color appears |

### B. Anatomy of the Eye

**Order light passes through the eye:**
1. **Cornea** (outer protective layer)
2. **Pupil/Iris** (opening that controls light entry)
3. **Lens** (focuses light)
4. **Vitreous humor** (gel-like fluid)
5. **Retina** (layer of neural cells)
   - Ganglion cells
   - Bipolar cells
   - **Photoreceptors** (rods & cones) ← TRANSDUCTION occurs here

**Important:** Light passes through several layers of retinal cells BEFORE reaching rods & cones!

### C. Transduction
**Definition:** The process by which a stimulus (e.g., visible light) is represented neurally (converted to neural signals)

### D. Photoreceptors: Rods vs. Cones

| Feature | Rods | Cones |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Vision type** | **Scotopic** (dim light/night vision) | **Photopic** (bright light/day vision) |
| **Detail** | General form only (NOT detail) | **Greater visual acuity** (detail) |
| **Number** | MORE numerous | LESS numerous |
| **Location** | More in **PERIPHERY** of retina | More in **CENTER** of retina; **ONLY cones in fovea** |
| **Dark adaptation** | More THOROUGHLY adapts to dark | Quickly adapts but LIMITED in how much |
| **Color vision** | NO color (black/white) | YES - responsible for color vision |

### E. Receptive Field
**Definition:** The portion of the visual field that a neuron "monitors" - if it detects a visual stimulus within its receptive field, it will respond

### F. Visual Pathway

**After transduction by rods/cones, information travels:**
1. **Bipolar cells**
2. **Ganglion cells**
3. **Optic disk** (ganglion axons pass through)
   - NO photoreceptors here = **BLIND SPOT**
   - We don't notice because:
     - Brain "completes" visual images
     - Eyes not in same place, so blind spots don't overlap
4. **Optic chiasm** (where some fibers cross)
   - **Nasal retina** (closer to nose) → crosses to OTHER side (**contralateral**)
   - **Temporal retina** (farther from nose) → stays on SAME side (**ipsilateral**)
5. **Dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus** (of thalamus)
6. **Primary Visual Cortex** (in occipital lobe) aka **V1** aka **striate cortex**

### G. Feature Detectors (in Primary Visual Cortex)

| Cell Type | What It Detects |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Simple cells** | Orientation of line AND location within receptive field |
| **Complex cells** | Orientation of line AND movement of line |
| **Hypercomplex cells** (end-stop cells) | Orientation of line AND length of line |

### H. Visual Processing Streams

| Pathway | Location | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **WHAT pathway** (Ventral) | Lower temporal lobe | Analyzes WHAT the object IS |
| **WHERE pathway** (Dorsal) | Parietal lobe | Analyzes WHERE the object is (for manipulation) |

### I. Theories of Color Vision

**Subtractive vs. Additive Color Mixing:**
- Subtractive: Mixing paints (absorbs wavelengths)
- Additive: Mixing light (adds wavelengths)

#### Trichromatic Theory (Young-Helmholtz)
- **3 types of cones** attuned to different wavelengths:
  - Short wavelength = **Blue** (~450 nm)
  - Medium wavelength = **Green**
  - Long wavelength = **Red**
- Each cone responds MOST to its preferred wavelength but also responds (weaker) to nearby wavelengths (bell curve)
- **Color blindness** = abnormalities in cone types
  - Most are **sex-linked** (more males than females)
  - EXCEPT blue blindness (very rare; equal male/female ratio)
- **Weakness:** Doesn't explain:
  - Why there's no "bluish-yellow" or "reddish-green"
  - Complementary afterimages

#### Opponent Process Theory (Hering)
- Neurons signal color by their **rate of firing**
- Neurons are paired as **opponents:**
  - Blue/Yellow neurons
  - Red/Green neurons
- A neuron may ↑ activity for blue and ↓ activity for yellow
- **Explains:**
  - Why no bluish-yellow or reddish-green (can't fire both ways at once!)
  - **Complementary afterimages** (rebound effect)

**Afterimage Explanation:**
1. Neurons have a basal (baseline) firing rate
2. When stimulated (e.g., see green), they become fatigued
3. When stimulus removed, **REBOUND effect** - fire opposite way
4. Brain interprets this as the complementary color (e.g., red)

**Which theory is correct?**
- **BOTH!**
- **Trichromatic** = at the level of PHOTORECEPTORS
- **Opponent Process** = at ALL OTHER levels (bipolar cells onward)

**Note:** Ambient light/overall illumination influences color perception (e.g., "the dress")

### J. Perceiving Form

#### Bottom-Up Processing (Feature Detection)
- Basic visual information → compiled into lines → compiled into complex shapes
- Building from simple features UP to complex perception

#### Top-Down Processing
- Information taken as a "whole"
- **Perceptual readiness** - we're hard-wired to see stimuli in certain ways

**Gestalt Principles:**

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Figure & Ground** | We separate images into foreground (figure) and background |
| **Proximity** | Items CLOSE to each other perceived as together |
| **Closure** | We "close" incomplete figures |
| **Similarity** | Similar elements perceived as together |
| **Simplicity** | We prefer simplest interpretation |
| **Continuity** | We follow smooth, continuous lines |

**Perceptual hypothesis:** We form hypotheses about what we're seeing

**Phi phenomenon:** Perceiving motion from stationary flashing lights

**Stroop effect:** When top-down and bottom-up processing INTERFERE (e.g., reading "RED" written in blue ink)

### K. Depth Perception

#### Monocular Cues (one eye)
- **Accommodation:** Lens changes shape to focus
- **Pictorial cues:**
  - Height in plane (lower = closer)
  - Linear perspective (parallel lines converge)
  - Texture gradient (details fade with distance)
  - Interposition (overlap = closer)
  - Light and shadow

#### Binocular Cues (two eyes)
- **Retinal disparity:** Difference in view between two eyes (closer objects = more disparity)

### L. Perceptual Constancies
- We perceive objects as constant despite changes in:
  - Size (size constancy)
  - Shape (shape constancy)
  - Color (color constancy)
  - Brightness (brightness constancy)

### M. Illusions
- Experience influences our perception
- Can be fooled by visual tricks

## III. Auditory System

### A. The Stimulus: Sound
- **Compression & decompression of molecules** (air, fluid, etc.)

| Property of Sound | What It Determines |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Wavelength/Frequency** | **Pitch** (lower frequency = lower pitch) |
| **Amplitude** | **Loudness** (greater amplitude = louder) |
| **Purity** | **Timbre** (quality of sound - why instruments sound different) |

### B. Anatomy of the Ear

**Order sound passes through:**

1. **OUTER EAR**
   - **Pinna** (ear canal) - movement of air molecules

2. **MIDDLE EAR**
   - **Tympanic membrane** (ear drum)
   - **Ossicles** (3 tiny bones):
     - Hammer (malleus)
     - Anvil (incus)
     - Stirrup (stapes)
   - Movement of tiny bones

3. **INNER EAR**
   - **Oval window** of the cochlea
   - Movement of fluid

### C. The Cochlea
- 3 canals - middle canal contains **basilar membrane**
- **Auditory hair cells** embedded in basilar membrane
- Filled with fluid
- Vibration moves fluid → basilar membrane moves → hair cells fire action potentials
- **TRANSDUCTION occurs at auditory hair cells**

### D. Theories of Pitch Perception

#### Place Theory
- Different frequencies stimulate different AREAS of basilar membrane
- **Higher frequencies** → areas CLOSEST to oval window
- **Lower frequencies** → areas FARTHER from oval window
- Brain perceives pitch based on WHICH area is stimulated
- **Best for HIGHER pitches**
- Weakness: Hair cells vibrate together (not completely independent)

#### Frequency Theory
- Basilar membrane MIMICS the sound waveform
- Neurons fire IN SYNCHRONY with the waveform (at each peak)
- How FREQUENTLY neurons fire tells brain the frequency
- **Best for LOWER pitches**

**Which is correct?** BOTH - Place theory for high pitches, Frequency theory for low pitches

### E. Sound Localization

| Cue | How It Works | Best For |
|-----|--------------|----------|
| **Loudness difference** | Sound louder in closer ear | - |
| **Sound shadow** | Head blocks some frequencies | **HIGH frequencies** |
| **Arrival time** | Sound arrives at closer ear first | **LOW frequencies** |

## IV. Vestibular System (Balance)

### A. Stimulus
- **Gravitational pull** and movement

### B. Anatomy
- Located in **INNER EAR** (near cochlea)
- **Semicircular canals** (3 fluid-filled tubes at right angles)
- **Vestibular sacs**
- Contain fluid and hair cells
- Movement causes fluid to move → moves hairs → neural signals (**TRANSDUCTION**)

---

## V. Gustatory System (Taste)

### A. Stimulus
- **Molecules dissolved in fluid** (saliva)

### B. Primary Tastes
1. Sweet
2. Sour
3. Bitter
4. Salty
5. **Umami** (savory)
6. Fat?? (possibly somatosensory)

**Different receptors** for each taste

**Taste vs. Flavor:** Taste is only the 5 primaries; Flavor includes smell!

### C. Anatomy of Tongue
- **Papillae** = bumps on tongue
- **Taste buds** = on sides of papillae; around perimeter of tongue
- **Taste density varies:**
  - 25% non-tasters
  - 50% medium tasters
  - 25% **super-tasters** (greater sensitivity to sweet/bitter)
- **Taste hairs** = ~10 days lifespan (**TRANSDUCTION occurs here**)
- **Pattern of firing** = different taste perception

### D. Primary Cortex
- **Insular cortex** (in frontal lobe)

---

## VI. Olfactory System (Smell)

### A. Stimulus
- **Molecules in the air**
- No established "primaries" (may not exist)

### B. Anatomy of Nose
- Air → mucous → **olfactory dendrites** (**TRANSDUCTION occurs here**)
- **Olfactory cilia** = ~1 month lifespan
- **Anosmia** = complete loss of smell (rare)
- **Pattern of firing** = different smell perception

### C. Primary Cortex
- **Olfactory bulb** (temporal lobe)

**CRITICAL:** Olfaction is the ONLY sensory system that does NOT send information to the **thalamus** before going to primary cortex!

---

## VII. Sensory Integration
- Sensory systems WORK TOGETHER
- Example: **Olfactory + Gustatory = FLAVOR**
  - When you have a stuffy nose, you can't taste flavors as well!

---

## VIII. Somatosensory System (Touch, Temperature, Pain)

### A. Stimuli (Multiple)
- Mechanical (pressure, touch)
- Thermal (temperature)
- Chemical

### B. Receptors
- Nerves embedded throughout body
- Many are **"polymodal"** - detect more than one type of stimulus

| Receptor Type | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| **Mechanoreceptors** | Touch, pressure (Ruffini endings, Merkel's discs, Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner's corpuscle, hair shaft receptor) |
| **Nociceptors** | Pain (free nerve endings) |
| **Thermoreceptors** | Temperature |
| **Proprioceptors** | Body position |

**Most receptors** in: fingers, lips, tongue

### C. Neural Pathway
Somatosensory receptors → **Thalamus** → **Somatosensory cortex** (parietal lobe)

**Somatosensory cortex has a MAP of the body!** (Homunculus - distorted based on sensitivity)

### D. Pain

#### Stimulus
- Something **noxious or damaging** to tissues
- Exception: some chronic pain

#### Pain Receptors (Nociceptors)

| Fiber Type | Speed | Sensation |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **C fibers** | SLOW pathway | Dull, aching pain |
| **A-delta fibers** | FAST pathway | Sharp pain (knife cut) |

Both travel through different parts of thalamus

#### Why Do We Need Pain?
- Signals danger/damage
- Motivates protective behavior
- Without pain, we'd injure ourselves repeatedly

#### Gate Control Theory (Melzack & Wall)
**Theory of how we MODULATE (control) pain**

**The "gate" can be opened or closed by:**

| Trigger Type | Location | Examples | Effect |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Peripheral** | Body/PNS | Rubbing injury, heat/cold, acupuncture | CLOSES gate (less pain) |
| **Central** | Brain/CNS | Distraction, positive emotions, expectations | Can OPEN or CLOSE gate |

**Gate location:** Spinal cord and/or thalamus

## Practice Questions:

1. In what order does light pass through the eye before transduction occurs?

2. Why do we have two theories of color vision, and when does each apply?

3. A person stares at a green square for 30 seconds, then looks at a white wall. What will they see and why?

4. What is the ONLY sense that doesn't go through the thalamus?

5. What's the difference between C fibers and A-delta fibers?

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

1. Cornea → Pupil/Iris → Lens → Vitreous humor → Retina (through ganglion cells, bipolar cells, then to rods & cones where transduction occurs)

2. Trichromatic theory works at the photoreceptor level (3 cone types), but doesn't explain afterimages or why we can't see "reddish-green." Opponent process theory works at bipolar cells and beyond, explaining these phenomena through neural firing rates.

3. They'll see a RED square (complementary afterimage). The green-detecting neurons became fatigued; when the green is removed, they have a "rebound effect" and fire as if detecting red.

4. **Olfaction (smell)** - goes directly to olfactory bulb without passing through thalamus first

5. **C fibers** = slow pathway, dull/aching pain; **A-delta fibers** = fast pathway, sharp pain (like knife cut)
