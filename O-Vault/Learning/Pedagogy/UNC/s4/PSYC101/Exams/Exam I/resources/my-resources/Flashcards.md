## **CATEGORY: ORIGINS & FOUNDATIONS**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|What two fields did psychology originate from?|**Philosophy** (rationalism - using reason) and **Physiology** (empiricism - using scientific observation/testing)|
|Define **Rationalism**|Gaining knowledge through REASON and LOGIC (thinking, deducing) - from philosophy|
|Define **Empiricism**|Gaining knowledge through OBSERVATION and EXPERIENCE (testing, experimenting) - from physiology|
|Why does psychology need BOTH rationalism and empiricism?|Rationalism helps form hypotheses and design studies; Empiricism tests if the reasoning is actually correct. Need to "think smart, then test it"|
|Which philosopher is associated with rationalism in psychology's origins?|**Descartes**|
|Which physiologist is associated with empiricism in psychology's origins?|**Helmholtz** (measured nerve conduction speed)|

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|Can a division be BOTH research and applied?|**YES** - Clinical, Experimental, Educational, and School Psychology can be both|
|Structuralism is like the periodic table because...|It tries to break consciousness into BASIC ELEMENTS (like chemistry breaks matter into elements)|
|Functionalism was inspired by which scientist's theory?|**Charles Darwin** - theory of evolution/natural selection|
|Why did functionalism focus on "WHY" instead of "WHAT"?|Darwin showed traits exist because they're ADAPTIVE (help survival), so functionalists asked "what purpose does consciousness serve?"|
