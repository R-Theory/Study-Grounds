# **Evolution of Psychology (~10 questions)**

## **Core Learning Objectives:**

### **1. ORIGINS OF PSYCHOLOGY**

**Key Concept:** Psychology emerged from TWO fields:

**PHILOSOPHY** (Rationalism - using reason)

- Example: Descartes asking "How do we know what we know?"
- Method: Logical thinking, deduction

**PHYSIOLOGY** (Empiricism - using observation/testing)

- Example: Helmholtz measuring nerve conduction speed
- Method: Scientific experiments

**❓ Test Yourself:** Why did psychology need BOTH fields?

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> Philosophy gave psychology big questions about the mind; Physiology gave it scientific methods to answer them. You need both "what to study" and "how to study it." </details>

### **2. KEY FIGURES - You MUST memorize these:**

**Wilhelm Wundt (1879)**

- **What:** Founded first psychology lab (Germany)
- **Focus:** Consciousness, reaction time
- **Why it matters:** Made psychology a SCIENCE
- **Mnemonic:** **W**undt = **W**orld's first lab

**William James**

- **What:** First US psychology lab, wrote "Principles of Psychology"
- **Concept:** "Stream of consciousness"
- **School:** Functionalism
- **Mnemonic:** **J**ames = **J**ournal founder

**Stanley Hall**

- **What:** First US lab (1882), founded American Journal of Psychology

**Mary Calkins, Margaret Washburn, Leta Hollingworth**

- **Why crucial:** Major contributors but faced discrimination
- **Exam trap:** You might see a question about early women in psychology

### **3. SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT - This is HUGE for the exam**

Let me create a comparison table you need to MASTER:

|School|Leader|Main Idea|Method|Analogy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Structuralism**|Titchener|Break consciousness into ELEMENTS|Introspection|Like chemistry's periodic table|
|**Functionalism**|James|How mind helps us ADAPT/SURVIVE|Study purpose|Like biology studying why hearts pump|
|**Psychoanalysis**|Freud|UNCONSCIOUS drives behavior|Dream analysis, free association|Like an iceberg - most is hidden|
|**Behaviorism**|Watson, Skinner|Only study OBSERVABLE behavior|Experiments with rewards/punishment|Like training a dog - ignore thoughts|
|**Humanism**|Rogers, Maslow|Human potential, FREE WILL, growth|Client-centered therapy|Like a plant needing sun to grow|

**🔥 CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:**

**Structuralism vs. Functionalism:**

- **Structuralism:** "WHAT are the parts of consciousness?" (like dissecting)
- **Functionalism:** "WHY does consciousness exist?" (Darwin's influence)

**❓ Application Question:** _A researcher asks: "What is the evolutionary purpose of fear?" Which school?_

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> Functionalism - asking about PURPOSE and ADAPTATION </details>

### **4. MODERN PERSPECTIVES - Know these cold:**

**Research Divisions:**

1. **Clinical Psychology** - studying/treating mental disorders
2. **Cognitive Psychology** - studying mental processes (memory, thinking)
3. **Developmental Psychology** - studying changes across lifespan
4. **Social Psychology** - how others influence us
5. **Physiological/Biological Psychology** - brain & behavior
6. **Experimental Psychology** - conducting controlled experiments
7. **Personality Psychology** - individual differences
8. **Psychometrics** - psychological testing/measurement

**Applied Divisions:**

- Clinical (also applied)
- Counseling
- School Psychology
- Industrial/Organizational

**❓ Exam-Style Question:** _Dr. Martinez studies how damage to the hippocampus affects memory formation. Which division?_

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> Physiological/Biological Psychology - focuses on brain-behavior relationships </details>

## **Practice Questions for Chapter 1:**

Let me give you some challenging ones:

**1.** What technique did structuralists use, and why is it problematic?

**2.** "Give me a dozen healthy infants..." - Who said this and what does it demonstrate about their view?

**3.** If someone studies "what motivates employees to work harder" - research or applied division?

Want me to continue with **Chapter 2: Research Methods** next? This is often the HARDEST chapter because it requires applying concepts to scenarios. I'll make sure you can:

- Design experiments
- Identify IVs and DVs
- Spot confounding variables
- Understand statistics

Should I proceed?
