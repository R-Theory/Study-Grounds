# CHAPTER 1: EVOLUTION OF PSYCHOLOGY
What two fields did psychology originate from?	<b>Philosophy</b> (rationalism - using reason) and <b>Physiology</b> (empiricism - using scientific observation/testing)	PSYC101::Ch1::Origins
Define Rationalism	Gaining knowledge through REASON and LOGIC (thinking, deducing) - from philosophy	PSYC101::Ch1::Origins
