## **CATEGORY: VISUAL FIELD & LESION SCENARIOS - HIGH YIELD**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|If you **remove the RIGHT eye**, how is vision affected?|Lose the RIGHT eye's view; LEFT eye still sees most of visual field but lose some peripheral vision on the right side|
|If you **remove the LEFT eye**, how is vision affected?|Lose the LEFT eye's view; RIGHT eye still sees most of visual field but lose some peripheral vision on the left side|
|To completely blind someone to the **LEFT visual field**, what do you lesion?|**Right occipital cortex** OR **right optic tract** (after the chiasm) - because left visual field goes to RIGHT hemisphere|
|To completely blind someone to the **RIGHT visual field**, what do you lesion?|**Left occipital cortex** OR **left optic tract** (after the chiasm) - because right visual field goes to LEFT hemisphere|
|Why does the LEFT visual field go to the RIGHT brain?|At the **optic chiasm**, nasal fibers CROSS; temporal fibers stay same side. Left visual field hits right side of BOTH retinas, and those signals go to right brain|
|What is **Hemianopia**?|Blindness in HALF the visual field (left or right) - caused by damage after optic chiasm|
|If you cut the **optic chiasm** down the middle, what happens?|Lose peripheral vision in BOTH eyes (tunnel vision) - because crossing nasal fibers are cut|
|If you lesion the **right optic nerve** (before chiasm), what happens?|Complete blindness in RIGHT eye only|

## **CATEGORY: WHY TWO THEORIES? - CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|WHY do we need BOTH trichromatic AND opponent process theories for color?|They explain color vision at **DIFFERENT LEVELS**: Trichromatic at photoreceptors (3 cone types); Opponent process at bipolar cells and beyond (neural processing)|
|What does **Trichromatic theory** explain that Opponent Process cannot?|How we detect color at the receptor level - 3 cone types for different wavelengths|
|What does **Opponent Process theory** explain that Trichromatic cannot?|1. Why we see **afterimages** (neural fatigue/rebound)<br>2. Why there's no "reddish-green" or "bluish-yellow" (opponent neurons can't increase AND decrease simultaneously)|
|WHY do we need BOTH place AND frequency theories for pitch?|Each works for **DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES**: Place theory for HIGH pitches; Frequency theory for LOW pitches|
|What does **Place theory** explain that Frequency theory cannot?|High frequency discrimination - different locations on basilar membrane vibrate for different high pitches|
|What does **Frequency theory** explain that Place theory cannot?|Low frequency perception - neurons fire in sync with low-frequency sound waves (neurons can't fire fast enough for high frequencies)|
|At what frequency do the pitch theories "switch"?|Around **1000-4000 Hz** - below this, frequency theory dominates; above this, place theory dominates|
|Key takeaway about "two theories" in sensation?|When you see TWO theories for the same sense, they usually operate at **different levels or ranges** - BOTH are correct!|
