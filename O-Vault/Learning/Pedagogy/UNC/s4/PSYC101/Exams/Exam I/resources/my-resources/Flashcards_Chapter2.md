# Chapter 2: Research Methods Flashcards

## **CATEGORY: RESEARCH FOUNDATIONS**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|Define **Rationalism**|Gaining knowledge through **REASON and LOGIC** (thinking, deducing, forming hypotheses)|
|Define **Empiricism**|Gaining knowledge through **OBSERVATION and EXPERIENCE** (testing, experimenting, collecting data)|
|Why does research need BOTH rationalism and empiricism?|Rationalism helps form hypotheses; Empiricism tests if the reasoning is correct. "Think smart, then test it."|
|What are the 3 goals of research?|1. **Measurement and description** (accurately describe behavior)<br>2. **Understanding and prediction** (explain and predict)<br>3. **Application and control** (solve real-world problems)|

## **CATEGORY: TYPES OF RESEARCH METHODS**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|What is an **Experiment**?|Research method with **manipulation** of a variable, **random assignment**, and control over extraneous variables|
|What can ONLY experiments determine?|**CAUSALITY** (cause-and-effect relationships)|
|What is a **Quasi-Experiment**?|Looks like experiment but IV has **NOT been manipulated** by experimenter|
|Can quasi-experiments make causal conclusions?|**NO** - cannot determine cause and effect|
|What is **Naturalistic Observation**?|Observing phenomenon in its natural setting without interference|
|Advantages of Naturalistic Observation?|1. Observe naturally<br>2. Good starting point for unknown topics<br>3. Can use with animals|
|Disadvantages of Naturalistic Observation?|1. Reactivity (hard to be unobtrusive)<br>2. Qualitative data hard to analyze<br>3. Environment can be chaotic|
|What is a **Case Study**?|In-depth study of a single individual or small group|
|Advantages of Case Study?|1. In-depth view of phenomenon<br>2. Compelling real-life evidence|
|Disadvantages of Case Study?|1. Lack of objectivity<br>2. May be unusual case (not generalizable)|
|What is a **Survey**?|Questionnaire or interview administered to a sample|
|Advantages of Survey?|1. Get data on hard-to-observe behavior<br>2. Large sample sizes possible|
|Disadvantages of Survey?|1. Sampling bias from declining response rates<br>2. Self-report issues|

## **CATEGORY: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN - CRITICAL**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|What is a **Variable**?|Anything that can vary/change (e.g., intelligence level, hair color)|
|What is the **Independent Variable (IV)**?|The variable that is **MANIPULATED** by the experimenter (presumed CAUSE)|
|What is the **Dependent Variable (DV)**?|The variable that is **MEASURED**; may be affected by IV (presumed EFFECT)|
|In "Do blondes have more fun?" what is the IV?|**Hair color** (manipulated)|
|In "Do blondes have more fun?" what is the DV?|**Amount of fun** (measured)|
|What are **Levels** of a study?|Number of ways the IV is manipulated (e.g., blonde, brunette, red = 3 levels)|
|What is the **Experimental Group**?|The group "of interest" that receives the treatment|
|What is the **Control Group**?|Comparison group (no treatment or different treatment)|
|What is **Random Assignment**?|Each participant has an **EQUAL chance** of being assigned to ANY group|
|Why is random assignment important?|1. Decreases chances groups differ BEFORE manipulation<br>2. Spreads extraneous variables equally<br>3. Without it, results are CONFOUNDED|

## **CATEGORY: EXTRANEOUS VS. CONFOUNDING VARIABLES**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|What is an **Extraneous Variable**?|Variable that COULD influence results BUT is spread **EQUALLY** across groups|
|What is a **Confounding Variable**?|Variable that influences results AND is **NOT equal** across groups|
|Does an extraneous variable invalidate a study?|**NO** - study still valid (it's controlled for)|
|Does a confounding variable invalidate a study?|**YES** - study is INVALID/inconclusive|
|IQ in SAT study: Groups have SIMILAR average IQ|**Extraneous variable** - controlled for, study valid|
|IQ in SAT study: One group has 20-point higher IQ|**Confounding variable** - study invalid|
|How does random assignment help with confounding variables?|Converts potential **confounding** variables into **extraneous** variables!|
|What is a **Within-Subject/Repeated Measures** design?|Same participants tested under ALL conditions|
|What is **counterbalancing**?|Varying the order of conditions to control for order effects|

## **CATEGORY: STATISTICS**

|What are measures of **Dispersion**?|Standard deviation, variance|
|What is a **Correlation Coefficient (r)**?|Number from -1 to +1 showing strength and direction of relationship|
|What does **r = .2** indicate?|Negligible correlation|
|What does **r = .5** indicate?|Moderate correlation|
|What does **r = .8** indicate?|Very strong correlation|
|What does **r = 1** indicate?|Perfect relationship|
|What does a **positive correlation** mean?|Variables move in the **SAME** direction|
|What does a **negative correlation** mean?|Variables move in **OPPOSITE** directions|
|Does correlation mean causation?|**NO!** Correlation does NOT equal causation!|
|What is the **3rd Variable Problem**?|A third variable could be causing BOTH correlated variables|
|Ice cream sales correlate with drowning deaths. Why?|**3rd variable** = summer heat causes both!|
|What are **Inferential Statistics**?|Statistics that determine if sample results can be **GENERALIZED to population**|
|What does **p < .05** mean?|Less than 5% chance results are a fluke → **CAN generalize** to population|
|What does **p > .05** mean?|Greater than 5% chance results are a fluke → **CANNOT generalize**|
|Examples of inferential statistics?|T-tests, Chi-test, F-test, Multiple regression|

## **CATEGORY: PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH MYTHS**

|FRONT (Question/Term)|BACK (Answer/Definition)|
|---|---|
|Myth: "Psychology is just common sense"|**FALSE** - Many findings are counterintuitive; common sense often contradicts itself; research reveals surprising truths|
