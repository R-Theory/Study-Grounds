# Biological Bases of Behavior (~10 questions)

## Rules of Thumb for Biological Psychology:
1. **Named via shape, function, location, and/or discoverer** (e.g., dendrite, hypothalamus, nodes of Ranvier)
2. **Named more than once** (e.g., Glia = glial cells = neural glia; Serotonin = 5-HT)
3. **Different shape = different function**

## I. Cells of the Brain

### A. Neurons
**Function:** Receives, processes, and transmits information

#### Neuron Anatomy:

| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Dendrites & dendritic spines** | RECEIVE information from other neurons |
| **Soma (cell body)** | Contains nucleus (genetic material) and organelles (e.g., mitochondria); PROCESSES information |
| **Axon** | TRANSMITS information away from cell body |
| **Myelin sheath** | Insulation that SPEEDS UP signal transmission |
| **Nodes of Ranvier** | Gaps in myelin where action potential "jumps" |
| **Terminal buttons** | End of axon; releases neurotransmitters |

### B. Glia (Glial Cells)
**Nickname:** "Glue" of the brain (but has MANY functions)

| Type | Location | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Oligodendrocytes** | CNS | Create myelin; ONE cell can myelinate MULTIPLE axons |
| **Schwann cells** | PNS | Create myelin; ONE cell creates only ONE segment on ONE axon |
| **Astrocytes** | Both | Synchronize neuron communication, nurture cells, remove waste |
| **Microglia** | Both | Immune system function; remove waste, bacteria, viruses |
| **Radial glia** | Both | Guide migration & growth of immature neurons |

## II. Types of Neural Signals

### A. Synapses (Connections Between Neurons)
- **Axo-dendritic:** Axon to dendrite
- **Axo-somatic:** Axon to soma
- **Axo-axonic:** Axon to axon

### B. Action Potential
**Definition:** Electrical AND chemical signal that travels down the AXON

**Properties:**
| Property | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **All-or-none** | Either fires completely or not at all (no partial firing) |
| **Threshold of excitation** | Minimum stimulation needed to trigger action potential |
| **Absolute refractory period** | Brief time when neuron CANNOT fire again no matter what |
| **Relative refractory period** | Time when neuron CAN fire but needs STRONGER stimulation |

**Myelin sheath** makes action potential travel FASTER (saltatory conduction)

### C. EPSPs & IPSPs

| Type | Full Name | Effect | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **EPSP** | Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential | Makes neuron MORE likely to fire | Depolarization |
| **IPSP** | Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential | Makes neuron LESS likely to fire | Hyperpolarization |

**Properties:**
- Electrical AND chemical signals
- **Cable properties:** No threshold, strength varies, degrades over time/distance
- EPSPs & IPSPs are SUMMATED (added together)

**Summation Rules:**
- If EPSPs > IPSPs AND reaches threshold → Action potential in postsynaptic neuron
- If IPSPs > EPSPs OR doesn't reach threshold → NO action potential

**Important:** Neurons are NOT silent at rest - they fire at a **basal rate**
- More EPSPs → Increased firing rate
- More IPSPs → Decreased firing rate

## III. Neurotransmitters

### How Neurotransmission Works:
1. Action potential reaches **terminal buttons**
2. **Exocytosis** - neurotransmitter released from vesicles
3. Neurotransmitter diffuses across **synapse** (fluid-filled gap)
4. **Presynaptic neuron** = sends the message
5. **Postsynaptic neuron** = receives the message
6. Neurotransmitter binds to matching **receptor** at **binding site**
7. Causes EPSP or IPSP in postsynaptic neuron
8. Neurotransmitter unbinds
9. **Reuptake** (recycled) and/or **enzymatic degradation** (broken down)

### Key Neurotransmitters:

| Neurotransmitter | Also Known As | Main Functions |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **GABA** | - | Main INHIBITORY neurotransmitter |
| **Glutamate** | - | Main EXCITATORY neurotransmitter |
| **Acetylcholine (ACh)** | Cholinergic | PNS: Muscle contractions<br>CNS: Arousal, attention, learning, memory |
| **Dopamine (DA)** | Dopaminergic | Movement, addictions, mood |
| **Norepinephrine (NE)** | Noradrenergic | Mood, arousal |
| **Epinephrine** | Epi, Adrenergic | PNS: Cardiac contraction<br>CNS: Mood |
| **Serotonin** | 5-HT, Serotonergic | Sleep/arousal, mood, eating, aggression, impulsivity |
| **Endorphins** | Neuropeptide | Modulate/decrease PAIN |

### Neurotransmitter Categories:
- **Monoamines:** DA, NE, Epi, Serotonin
- **Catecholamines** (subcategory of monoamines): DA, NE, Epi
- **Indolamines** (subcategory of monoamines): Serotonin

### Agonists vs. Antagonists:

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Agonist** | INCREASES neurotransmitter activity | Nicotine (cholinergic agonist), Black widow venom (cholinergic agonist) |
| **Antagonist** | DECREASES/BLOCKS neurotransmitter activity | Botulinum toxin (cholinergic antagonist), Curare (cholinergic antagonist) |

### Where Neurotransmitters Come From:
- **Catecholamines:** Phenylalanine → Tyrosine → L-Dopa → **Dopamine** → **Norepinephrine** → **Epinephrine**
- **Serotonin:** Tryptophan → **Serotonin** → can become Melatonin (makes you sleepy)

## IV. Organization of the Nervous System

```
                    Nervous System (NS)
                           |
            --------------------------------
            |                              |
    Central NS (CNS)              Peripheral NS (PNS)
    (Brain + Spinal Cord)                  |
                                   ----------------
                                   |              |
                               Somatic        Autonomic
                               (voluntary)    (involuntary)
                                                  |
                                          ----------------
                                          |              |
                                    Sympathetic    Parasympathetic
                                    (fight/flight)  (rest/digest)
```

### Key Terms:
- **Afferent:** "Approaching" the brain (sensory info coming IN)
- **Efferent:** "Exiting" the brain (motor commands going OUT)
- **Spinal cord injuries:** PERMANENT; affects functions from injury level DOWNWARD

---

## V. Methods to Study the Brain

### Brain Damage Studies
- Study people with brain damage to understand function

### Lesioning (Controlled Damage)
- **Methods:** Knife cut, electrolytic lesion, aspiration
- **Sham studies:** Control group gets surgery but NO actual lesion (controls for surgery effects)

### Stimulation
- **Electrical stimulation**
- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)** / repetitive TMS (rTMS)
- **Chemical stimulation**

### Brain Imaging:

| Tool | Type of Info | How It Works |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **CT scan** | STRUCTURAL | Multiple X-rays |
| **MRI** | STRUCTURAL | Large magnet, NO radiation, BEST resolution |
| **PET scan** | FUNCTIONAL | Radioactive glucose, measures blood flow |
| **fMRI** | BOTH (structural + functional) | Measures blood flow & oxygen; not as good resolution as MRI |

---

## VI. Brain Anatomy

### Guiding Principles:
- **Lower/medial = primitive/vital functions** (evolutionarily old)
- **Higher/outer = higher mental functions** (evolutionarily newer)

### Hindbrain (Base of Brain)

| Structure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Medulla** | Vital functions: breathing, heart rate, blood pressure |
| **Pons** | Sleep, arousal, connects parts of brain |
| **Cerebellum** | Motor coordination, balance, "little brain" |
| **Reticular formation** | Spans medulla to midbrain<br>Ascending: Wakefulness/sleep<br>Descending: Motor movement |

### Midbrain

| Structure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Superior colliculi** | Visual information processing |
| **Inferior colliculi** | Auditory information processing |
| **Substantia nigra** | DA-producing neurons (Parkinson's disease affects this) |
| **Periaqueductal gray** | Pain modulation (opioids released here decrease pain) |

### Forebrain

| Structure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Thalamus** | "Sensory relay station" - ALL senses go here EXCEPT olfaction (smell)<br>Critical for consciousness |
| **Hypothalamus** | "4 Fs" - Fighting, Fleeing, Feeding, Mating<br>Controls pituitary gland |
| **Limbic system** | Emotional processing (includes thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala) |
| **Hippocampus** | Memory formation |
| **Amygdala** | Fear, emotional memories |
| **Corpus callosum** | Connects left and right hemispheres |

### Cerebral Cortex ("Bark")
- Where HIGHER mental functions occur
- **Gray matter** (cell bodies) vs. **White matter** (myelinated axons beneath)

#### Four Lobes:

| Lobe | Location | Primary Cortex |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Occipital** | Back of head | Primary VISUAL cortex |
| **Temporal** | Sides (temples) | Primary AUDITORY cortex |
| **Parietal** | Top/back | Primary SOMATOSENSORY cortex |
| **Frontal** | Front | Primary MOTOR cortex + Prefrontal cortex |

**Prefrontal cortex:**
- Executive functions: planning, working memory, inhibiting impulses
- Does NOT fully mature until ~25 years old!

**Primary cortex vs. Association areas:**
- **Primary:** Initial processing of sensory info
- **Association:** Higher-level interpretation and integration

#### Brain Surface Terms:
- **Sulcus (sulci):** Groove
- **Gyrus (gyri):** Bump/ridge
- **Fissure:** Very deep groove

---

## VII. Cerebral Specialization (Lateralization)

### Left Hemisphere:
- Language (for most people)
- **Broca's area:** Speech PRODUCTION
- **Wernicke's area:** Speech COMPREHENSION

### Right Hemisphere:
- Spatial processing
- Emotional processing

### Split-Brain Research:
- **Why done?** Last resort for uncontrollable epilepsy
- **Procedure:** Cut corpus callosum
- **Results:** Evidence of lateralization when tested carefully

**Key finding:** If picture flashed in LEFT visual field → goes to RIGHT hemisphere → patient CANNOT say what they saw (language is in left hemisphere)

---

## VIII. Plasticity

**Definition:** Brain's ability to change in response to experience

**Examples:**
- Musicians have larger somatosensory areas for fingers
- Amputees: brain area for missing limb gets "taken over" by neighboring areas
- **Neurogenesis:** New neurons created in SOME areas (hippocampus, olfactory bulb)
- **Synaptogenesis:** New synaptic connections formed

---

## IX. Endocrine System

- Works WITH nervous system
- **Hypothalamus** controls **pituitary gland** ("master gland")
- **Hormones:** Chemical messengers (slower than neurotransmitters)
- **Oxytocin:** "Bonding hormone" - released during social bonding, childbirth

---

## X. Hereditary Studies

### Nature vs. Nurture
- It's BOTH genes AND environment
- Genes = vulnerability/predisposition, NOT destiny

### Methods to Estimate Heritability:

| Method | How It Works | Flaw |
|--------|--------------|------|
| **Family studies** | Compare rates of trait in affected vs. non-affected families | Families share BOTH genes AND environment - can't separate effects |
| **Twin studies** | Compare concordance rates between MZ (identical, 100% genes) and DZ (fraternal, 50% genes) twins | MZ twins may also share MORE similar environments |
| **Adoption studies** | Compare adopted children to biological vs. adoptive relatives | Small sample sizes; twins may still have similar environments |

**Concordance rate:** Rate of agreement between twin pairs
- If MZ concordance > DZ concordance → suggests genetic influence

### Modern Approaches:
- **Genome-wide association studies:** Map specific genes
- **Polygenic:** Most traits influenced by MANY genes
- **Epigenetics:** Environment can turn genes ON/OFF; epigenetic marks can be inherited

---

## XI. Ventricles & CSF

- **Ventricles:** Hollow spaces in brain filled with fluid
- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):** Cushions brain inside and out
- CSF created in ventricles → circulates → absorbed into blood
- **Hydrocephalus:** "Water on the brain" - blocked CSF circulation

---

## Practice Questions:

1. What's the difference between oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells?

2. A drug that blocks acetylcholine receptors would be called a _______ and might cause what symptoms?

3. If you damage the thalamus, what sense would still work somewhat? Why?

4. What would happen to a person's ability to speak if Broca's area was damaged?

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

1. Oligodendrocytes are in CNS and can myelinate multiple axons; Schwann cells are in PNS and only myelinate one segment of one axon

2. Cholinergic antagonist; might cause muscle paralysis (ACh controls muscle contractions in PNS), memory problems, decreased attention (ACh involved in memory/attention in CNS)

3. Olfaction (smell) - it's the ONLY sense that doesn't go through thalamus before reaching primary cortex

4. Broca's area = speech PRODUCTION, so they could understand language but would have difficulty producing speech (Broca's aphasia)
