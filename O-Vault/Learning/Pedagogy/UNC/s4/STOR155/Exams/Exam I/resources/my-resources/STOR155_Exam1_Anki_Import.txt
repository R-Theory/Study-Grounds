# TOPIC 1: BASICS OF DATA
What is a variable?	A characteristic/attribute that can take <b>different values</b> across observations	STOR155::T1::Variables
What are the two main types of variables?	<b>Numerical</b> (quantitative) and <b>Categorical</b> (qualitative)	STOR155::T1::Variables
What are the two subtypes of numerical variables?	<b>Discrete</b> (countable: 0,1,2,3...) and <b>Continuous</b> (any value in a range)	STOR155::T1::Variables
What are the two subtypes of categorical variables?	<b>Nominal</b> (no order: eye color) and <b>Ordinal</b> (has order: education level)	STOR155::T1::Variables
Can numbers be categorical? Example?	<b>YES!</b> Zip codes, jersey numbers, SSN - if averaging is <b>meaningless</b>, it's categorical	STOR155::T1::Variables
What is the population?	The <b>ENTIRE</b> group you want to study/make conclusions about	STOR155::T1::PopSample
What is a sample?	A <b>SUBSET</b> of the population that you actually collect data from	STOR155::T1::PopSample
What is a parameter?	A number describing the <b>POPULATION</b> (usually unknown)	STOR155::T1::PopSample
