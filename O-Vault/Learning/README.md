# Learning

> The root content directory of the Obsidian vault — all study notes and knowledge artifacts are organized below this point.

---

## Purpose

This directory is the top-level container inside the vault. It mirrors the repo root's three learning method directories (Pedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy) but holds **notes and study materials** rather than source code and course files.

## What Belongs Here

- Subdirectories for each learning method (Pedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy)
- Nothing at this level directly — all content lives in the subdirectories

## Structure

```
